						<h1>Learn HTML By Playing Around</h1>
						<p class="lead">Here's a secret: most computer programmers haven't formally studied the tools and languages they use all day.  Instead, they learn by playing around.  They try things out, make mistakes, and go down wrong pathways all the time.  But the process is educational, engaging, and most of all fun.</p>
						<p class="lead">Here's how you can learn the basics of web programming by just playing around.</p>

				<p class="lead">Web programming consists of four basic technologies: HTML, CSS, a programming language, and a database.  I suggest learning them in that order, since each one can build off the one before it.</p>
				<p class="lead">The first step is to find a way to easily experiment with whatever you're doing.  Most web programmers use a bewildering number of tools and applications to work &#151; a text editor, the command line, a web server, and a browser.  I recommend avoiding a lot of that hassle and instead starting with a service like <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>, which lets you program directly in your browser and not worry about all the extra pieces (and it's free!).  You can &mdash; and should &mdash; learn about all the other pieces down the road, but don't need to immediately.</p>

				<p class="lead">HTML is the code that browsers read to display web pages.  Every web page you visit is (mostly) just a bunch of HTML behind the scenes.  And the cool thing is that you can view that HTML easily in any browser.  How you do it varies from browser to browser.  I recommend using Google Chrome &mdash; it has lots of built-in tools that make playing around with HTML fun and easy.  In Chrome, select View from the upper menu, then Developer, then View Source.</p>
				<p class="lead">Now, many popular websites use very advanced techniques to make their pages load as quickly as possible.  If you look at their source code, chances are it will just look like gibberish.  Try finding some simpler sites and look at the HTML from those sites to get a feel for how HTML works.</p>
				<p class="lead">If you can't find any simple sites, never fear!  I've created a few for you to play with.  Each of the links below will open in a new browser window.  Click on them, and then view the source in your browser:</p>
				<ul class="lead">
					<li><a href="sample_html/1_simple.html" target="_blank">A super simple web page &#151; just text!</a>
					<li><a href="sample_html/2_basic_tags.html" target="_blank">Now let's introduce HTML tags</a>
					<li><a href="sample_html/3_more_tags.html" target="_blank">... and introduce even more tags</a>
					<li><a href="sample_html/4_html_structure.html" target="_blank">... and finally show proper HTML structure</a>
				</ul>
				<p class="lead">Now, try creating some of your own pages in the Cloud 9 IDE.</p>
