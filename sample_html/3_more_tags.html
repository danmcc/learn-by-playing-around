Here are a few more good tags to know:

<p>The "p" tag can be used around paragraphs to add space above and below text like this.</p>

You can also use the "break" tag to insert a manual line break, like this:<br/>
See?

<p>That last "br" tag was a little funny.  Many HTML tags start with two brackets like this: &lt; ... &gt; and end with the same brackets with a / in front of them, like this: &lt;/ ... &gt;.  That's because you're usually using them to surround a bunch of text.  But some tags that don't surround text don't need an end tag.  In that case, you put the slash at the end of the tag, like we did with &gl;br/&gt; above.</p>

<p>If you're looking at the source code of this page, you might wonder what the funny &lt; and &gt; letters do.  Those are considered special characters in HTML.  Since browsers interpret less than and greater than signs as HTML, we need a way to tell the browser to actually display those signs instead of treating them like HTML.  Using &lt; and &gt; does that.  There are actually a whole bunch of different entities that you can use.  A good list of them is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hey!  What was that funny "a" tag?  That's called an "anchor" tag, but is more commonly just called a link.  You can use that to link to other web pages.</p>

<P>By the way, HTML tags can be in either uppercase or lowercase -- it doesn't matter.  Most people these days use lowercase, but you can do whatever makes you happy.</p>

<p>Here are a few other tag you might enjoy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Here's how
	<li>you create
	<li>bulleted lists
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>And here's
	<li>a numbered
	<li>list
</ol>
