<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My web page!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Until this point, we've been a little naughty.  HTML documents are supposed to have a few standard tags in them so that browsers know how to process them correctly.  Fortunately, browsers aren't very uptight, so you can get away without using them.  But as you build more complicated web pages, it becomes important to use them so they're displayed correctly.</p>

		<p>The first tag a proper HTML page should use looks like this: &lt;!doctype html&gt;.  This tells the browser that your page is going to be an HTML page.</p>
		<p>Next, we want a tag that tells the browser, "the HTML is starting now!".  For that, you use the &lt;html&gt; tag.
		<p>HTML pages have two main parts: the "head", which contains information about the page like its title, and the "body", which contains everything that's actually shown on a web page.</p>
		<p>If you look at the source of this page, it will provide a simple template that you can use for your own web pages.</p>
	</body>
